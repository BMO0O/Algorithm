# Fibonacci_numbers_two_different_ways  

Python3  
This code show two different ways to make Fibonacci numbers.  
**First one** is a basic code of Fibonacci using recursive call.  
**Second one** is a python way to make Fibonacci numbers not using recursive call,  
so it is way better if you use python.  
I attached a timer to make easy to see how fast second one is compared to first ways.
