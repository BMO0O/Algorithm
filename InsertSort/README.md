# InsertSort
basic insert-sort algorithm in python

This is a basic insert sort algorithm in python.
When you implement this code, it will print a time that it takes to sort 100 numbers which are chosen between 1 to 1000.
Then in next line, it will be True or False that demonstrate if these numbers are really sorted.
